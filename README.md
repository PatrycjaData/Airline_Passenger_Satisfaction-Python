**Project name:** Airline Passenger Satisfaction

**Data source: **The dataset was obtained from Kaggle

<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/data>

**Main Goal: **To analyze and visualize passenger satisfaction, focusing
on gender differences.

**Description: **I have filtered the data to to separate records by
gender - female and male.

Then I visualized the results using pie chart. Pie charts shows the
percentage distribution of satisfaction between women and men.

Afterwards, I used bar plot to to compare the satisfaction of both
groups. The results indicate that more than half of both women and men
are neutral or dissatisfied.

Finally, descriptive statistics (using \`describe()\`) were used to
summarize all numeric columns in the dataset.
