**Project name: ** Airline Passenger Satisfaction

**Data source: **The dataset was obtained from Kaggle

<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/data>

**Main Goal: **To analyze and visualize passenger satisfaction, focusing
on gender differences.

**Description: **I have filtered the data to to separate records by
gender - female and male.

Then I visualized the results using pie chart. Pie charts shows the
percentage distribution of satisfaction between women and men.

Afterwards, I used bar plot to to compare the satisfaction of both
groups. The results indicate that more than half of both women and men
are neutral or dissatisfied.

Finally, I used descriptive statistics (\`describe()\`) to
summarize all numeric columns in the dataset.
