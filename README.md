<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction/data>

## Main Goal
To analyze and visualize passenger satisfaction, focusing on gender differences.

## Description
### Tools & libraries 
Python , Jupyter Notebook

I have imported `pandas` , `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries and uploaded the dataset using `pd.read_csv`. I explored basic information, checked structure and statistics. I have filtered the data to separate records by gender (female and male). Afterwards, I created bar charts to visualize the number of passengers per satisfaction category. Pie charts show the percentage distribution of satisfaction between women and men. Finally, I used bar plot to compare the satisfaction of both groups. 

## Results
The results indicate that more than half of both women and men are neutral or dissatisfied.
